  `HackNagpur prides itself as being Central Indiaâ€™s biggest community Hackathon, providing a platform to unleash the talents of the innovative developers worldwide and come together virtually to ideate, innovate and inspire one another and the community with their skills thereby leaving their mark in the community.`,
  `HN is the very first initiative by the community members of GDG Nagpur, bringing in together 20+ other communities to host this hackathon, which aims in creating a virtual co-working space for the participants coming from all over the world to brainstorm and create a virtual but real prototype from December 26, 2020 - December 30, 2020. We envision to create an environment where diversified minds come together to create and ideate solutions for real-life problems. `,
  `The most crucial part of such competitions lies where participants develop solutions within a limited time frame infused with the work pressure imposed, testing them beyond their limits, giving way to the most valuable part: the exposure and the learning experience presented to them.`,
